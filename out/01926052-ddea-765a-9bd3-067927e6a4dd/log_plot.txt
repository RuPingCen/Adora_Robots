    - The actual data you log to Rerun, such as point clouds, images, or text logs,
      will never be collected.
    - We don't log IP addresses.
    - We don't log your user name, file paths, or any personal identifiable data.
    - Usage data we do collect will be sent to and stored on servers within the EU.

    For more details and instructions on how to opt out, run the command:

    As this is this your first session, _no_ usage data has been sent yet,
    giving you an opportunity to opt-out first if you wish.

    Happy Rerunning!
